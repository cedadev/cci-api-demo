# CCI API Demo

This repository acts to demonstrate API interactions with the [CCI Open Data Portal](https://climate.esa.int/en/explore/access-climate-data/)

Here we demonstrate interacting with the [Opensearch API](https://ceos.org/document_management/Working_Groups/WGISS/Documents/WGISS%20Best%20Practices/CEOS%20OpenSearch%20Best%20Practice.pdf), 
finding data and using the different data access methods.

The Opensearch API is provided by CEDA at [https://archive.opensearch.ceda.ac.uk/opensearch/description.xml](https://archive.opensearch.ceda.ac.uk/opensearch/description.xml).

You can run the demo in a Jupyter Notebook using binder:
